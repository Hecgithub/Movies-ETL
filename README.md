## Summary

In this project, we aimed to extract, transform, and load to create data pipelines where information is moved from a source to a destination. Specifically, we prepared data for a hackathon where teams of analysts collaborate to work intensively on a project, using data to solve a problem. We gathered data from Wikipedia and Kaggle, combined them, and saved them into an SQL database so that the hackathon participants had a nice, clean dataset to use.
